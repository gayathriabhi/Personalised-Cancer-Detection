# Personalised-Cancer-Detection

Classify the given genetic variations/mutations based on evidence from text-based clinical literature.
There are nine different classes a genetic mutation can be classified into => Multi class classification problem

Constraints:

* Interpretability * Class probabilities are needed. * Penalize the errors in class probabilites => Metric is Log-loss. * No Latency constraints.

The metric used is log loss(as probability of prediction is important) and confusion matrix.
Some Feature Engineering techniques actually improve the model very much
